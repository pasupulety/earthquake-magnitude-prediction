## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand earthquake patterns using EDA  
- Engineer meaningful time-based features  
- Build and compare regression models  
- Evaluate models using RMSE  
- Visualize spatial and temporal earthquake trends  

---

## 📊 Key Results & Insights

- **Linear Regression RMSE:** ~0.428  
- **Random Forest RMSE:** ~0.429  
- Tree-based models captured non-linear patterns but showed similar performance to linear models  
- Earthquake magnitude is influenced most by:
  - Latitude  
  - Longitude  
  - Depth  
- Temporal features (Year, Month, Hour) showed lower predictive impact

## 📈 Visualizations Included

- Earthquake location heatmap  
- Time-series plot of average magnitude over years  
- Feature importance bar chart (Random Forest)  
- Depth vs Magnitude scatter plot  
- Magnitude distribution histogram
